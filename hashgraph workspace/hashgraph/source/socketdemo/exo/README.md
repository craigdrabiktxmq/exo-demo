Exo Framework for Hashgraph Application Development
===================================================

Exo is a framework for developing applications on the Swirlds Hashgraph platform.  Primarily, Exo offers features and an application architecture for getting transactions into a Hashgraph, processing those transactions once they've been accepted, and logging transactions out to persistent storage.

Exo was developed to provide the features that Swirlds' SDK lacks that I knew I would need to develop real-world applications.  I'm sure other folks have needs and ideasthat aren't on my radar yet, so I would encourage feature requests and development submissions from other Hashgraph developers.  The framework will only improve for everyone as more people get involved.

Features
--------

Exo implements the following feature set:
- Socket-based messaging for Java applications
- REST-based messaging for anything that can make HTTP requests
- An architecture for structuring transaction processing logic and automated routing of transactions to transaction processors
- A framework for logging processed transactions to a blockchain-based transaction log (blockchain the data structure, not blockchain the platform)

### More Information
There's more to learn about building Exo applications.  First, check out the (Exo Demo Application)[https://github.com/craigdrabiktxmq/exo-demo] and see how the demo is put together.  It illustrates all of the concepts currently supported by Exo, and is dockerized so you can easily run the application stack.

When you're ready to dive into development, check the [docs folder](docs/README.md) for additional README files that describe how to use each feature in more detail.
